</p>
<p>
	Over the years, I have had the privilege of traversing through various roles and industries, each
	 contributing its unique hue to the tapestry of my work life. I have currently been working across 
	 various parts of Western Australia in the Mining and Resources sector as a Senior Field Services 
	 Technician for 5 years.  Here I have gained extensive knowledge on workload and work flow. In the mines, 
	 precision, attention to detail, and adherence to safety protocols were paramount for the successful execution 
	 of tasks. Moreover, problem-solving was a crucial aspect of my mining job, finding innovative solutions to 
	 overcome obstacles daily and leading a team to reach goals within deadlines. 
</p>
<p>
	Before starting in the mining industry, I was previously working as a chef along the east coast of Australia 
	and Japan. I worked in the hospitality industry for over 5 years both in the kitchen and front of house. 
	During my early years in kitchens, I gained the skills of working under extreme pressure, perfecting every dish, 
	consistency,  efficiently managing my time, working as a team and having innovation to create something new and exciting.
